    "# CSCI 3022: Intro to Data Science - Spring 2019 Practicum 2\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Friday May 3**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",

    "- You may not use late days on the practicums nor can you drop your practicum grades. \n",
    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

    "In an effort to control the skyrocketing prices of real estate in the Colorado Front Range, Governor Polis implemented a cutting edge new intervention. This new program oversaw the introduction of ghosts back into their natural ecosystem, after the ghost population seriously dwindled in recent decades due to overhaunting. However, an unfortunate miscalculation has led to haunted houses becoming a very serious problem in Colorado. Modern problems require modern solutions, so Governor Polis has hired you and the famous hedgehog data scientist/part-time ghostbuster Amy to determine what features of a house may be used to best predict a `haunted` score, related to the probability that a house with the given features is haunted (higher $\\leftrightarrow$ more likely to be haunted).\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to use multiple linear regression to understand and predict what factors lead to increased haunted house hazard. You collected a data set from Haunted Zillow, the lesser-known database of haunted house prices and attributes. The data cover a variety of potential features, and you'll find this data in the file `houses.csv`. \n",

    "**Response**: \n",

    "- $\\texttt{age}$: age of the house, in years\n",

    "- $\\texttt{bathrooms}$: number of bathrooms\n",
    "- $\\texttt{distance metro}$: distance to the nearest major metropolitan area (in miles)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{distance cemetery}$: distance to the nearest cemetery (in miles)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{cats}$: the number of cats within a one-block radius of the house\n",
    "- $\\texttt{howls}$: the number of wolf howls heard on an average night in the house's neighborhood\n",
    "- $\\texttt{clouds}$: what percentage of the sky was covered by clouds (fraction, 0-1)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{precipitation}$: amount of precipitation in the past 72 hours (inches)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{misery index}$: an economic indicator for how miserable the average United States citizen is, based on the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. More [here](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/whats-the-misery-index.htm) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_(economics)).
