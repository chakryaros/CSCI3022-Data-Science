    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **5 PM on Friday February 15**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas, as well as in the zipped folder in which you obtained this assignment. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",

Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail. As soon as a player rolls doubles, they are let out of Jail and their turn ends. Let $D$ represent the event that a player rolls doubles.\n",

    "Sonic and Amy are two average hedgehogs who have to run around campus every day for classes and hobbies. When they leave the Engineering Center (E) from their Data Science class, they like to go to 5 other places on campus: the Gym ($G~$) to exercise, the Library ($L~$) to learn, the Hill ($H~$) to grab a sandwich, Weathertech Cafe ($W~$) for a pizza, and the mountains ($M~$) to frolic with their marmot friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some rules governing their movements throughout the fair city of Boulder:\n",
    "* When Sonic and/or Amy is leaving one location, they randomly select one of the available adjacent locations, with equal probability.\n",
    "* This includes back-tracking, but note that to return to their original location would require 2 moves.\n",
    "* Assume that all moves require the same amount of time.\n",
    "* They are also not allowed to stay put; they always must move to some *other* adjacent location.\n",
    "* Sonic and Amy also act **independently** of one another. That is, the probability that Sonic goes from one place to another is independent of Amy's movements.\n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\">Monopoly</a>).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 2, 7, 17, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect \\$50 or \\$100, or pay the bank \\$25 or \\$100.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 20 is **Free Parking**. If a player lands on Square 20, then they are awarded a Free Parking Bonus of \\$500. This should be a generic input variable to your `miniopoly_turn` function called `bonus`, so you can modify it later. But, the default value for `bonus` should be \\$500.\n",
    "\n",
