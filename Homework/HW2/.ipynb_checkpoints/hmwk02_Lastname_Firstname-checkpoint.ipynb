Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.

To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.

    "Sonic and Amy are two average hedgehogs who have to run around campus every day for classes and hobbies. When they leave the Engineering Center (E) from their Data Science class, they like to go to 5 other places on campus: the Gym ($G~$) to exercise, the Library ($L~$) to learn, the Hill ($H~$) to grab a sandwich, Weathertech Cafe ($W~$) for a pizza, and the mountains ($M~$) to frolic with their marmot friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some rules governing their movements throughout the fair city of Boulder:\n",
    "* When Sonic and/or Amy is leaving one location, they randomly select one of the available adjacent locations, with equal probability.\n",
    "* This includes back-tracking, but note that to return to their original location would require 2 moves.\n",
    "* Assume that all moves require the same amount of time.\n",
    "* They are also not allowed to stay put; they always must move to some *other* adjacent location.\n",
    "* Sonic and Amy also act **independently** of one another. That is, the probability that Sonic goes from one place to another is independent of Amy's movements.\n",
