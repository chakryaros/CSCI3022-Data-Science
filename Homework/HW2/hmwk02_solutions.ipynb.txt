    "Courtney, Nick and Jarrod are playing special version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\">Monopoly</a>. Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail. As soon as a player rolls doubles, they are let out of Jail and their turn ends. Let $D$ represent the event that a player rolls doubles.\n",

    "Sonic and Amy are two average hedgehogs who have to run around campus every day for classes and hobbies. When they leave the Engineering Center (E) from their Data Science class, they like to go to 5 other places on campus: the Gym ($G~$) to exercise, the Library ($L~$) to learn, the Hill ($H~$) to grab a sandwich, Weathertech Cafe ($W~$) for a pizza, and the mountains ($M~$) to frolic with their marmot friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some rules governing their movements throughout the fair city of Boulder:\n",
    "* When Sonic and/or Amy is leaving one location, they randomly select one of the available adjacent locations, with equal probability.\n",
    "* This includes back-tracking, but note that to return to their original location would require 2 moves.\n",
    "* Assume that all moves require the same amount of time.\n",
    "* They are also not allowed to stay put; they always must move to some *other* adjacent location.\n",
    "* Sonic and Amy also act **independently** of one another. That is, the probability that Sonic goes from one place to another is independent of Amy's movements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be the events that Amy goes to the Hill $H$ as her first or second location. Similarly, let $W_1$ and $W_2$ be the events that Amy goes to the Weathertech Cafe as her first or second location, respectively, and let\n",
    "$E_1$, $L_1$, $G_1$ and $M_1$ be the events that Amy goes to the Engineering Center, Library, Gym and Mountains as her first location.  Yes, Amy cannot actually go to some of these places in 1 step, and cannot get to the Hill or Weathertech Cafe from some of them in 1 step either, so a bunch of probabilities we write down are going to end up being 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to calculate the probability $P(H_1 \\cup H_2 \\cup W_1 \\cup W_2)$, and these events are all disjoint, so we can break this up as $P(H_1) + P(H_2) + P(W_1) + P(W_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "On Amy's first step from the Gym, she can go to any of the Hill, Library or Engineering Center with equal probability, so $P(H_1) = 1/3$ and $P(W_1) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for Amy's second step. We can use the Law of Total Probability (LTP) to map out all the possible ways she can arrive at the Hill in 2 steps:\n",
    "$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "P(H_2) &= P(H_2 \\mid G_1)P(G_1) &&+ P(H_2\\mid W_1)P(W_1) &&+ P(H_2\\mid M_1)P(M_1) &&+ P(H_2\\mid L_1)P(L_1) &&+ P(H_2\\mid H_1)P(H_1) &&+ P(H_2\\mid E_1)P(E_1) \\\\\n",

    "**Part B**: Use your function from **Part A** to simulate at least 5000 games of Miniopoly for 20 turns, 40 turns and 60 turns, and make a **density** histogram of the player's cash at the end of the game under all 3 scenarios for number of turns. The histogram box faces should be slightly transparent, so as to be able to tell the 3 game-length scenarios apart. For all three histograms, use bins of width \\$250, starting at 0 on the left and extending as far to the right as needed. As always, be sure to label your axes and include an informative legend.\n",

    "Comment on how the histogram shape changes as the game progresses. Namely, how does the length of the game affect the distribution of players' cash? How many modes are there, and why?"
